# Big-Data-Weather-ForeCasting
 I am addressing weather forecasting with Machine Learning and Big Data tools

For details you can read my report [presentation slides]([https://github.com/andrea-gasparini/big-data-weather-forecasting/blob/master/presentation.pdf](https://github.com/WinerDeCoder/Big-Data-Weather-Forecasting/blob/main/Weather%20ForeCasting.pdf)) or to the [Python Notebook]([https://github.com/andrea-gasparini/big-data-weather-forecasting/blob/master/project.ipynb](https://github.com/WinerDeCoder/Big-Data-Weather-Forecasting/blob/main/main.ipynb))

## Dataset

The dataset comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/selfishgene/historical-hourly-weather-data)
and contains hourly weather measurements data of **36** cities, collected from
2012 to 2017. This 5 years of data result in approximately **45.000** measurements
(for each city) of temperature, humidity, air pressure and the like.
